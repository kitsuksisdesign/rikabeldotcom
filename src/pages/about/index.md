### Who I am

I'm a frontend developer, UX and UI designer. I have extensive experience with Drupal, moderate experience with WordPress and am just entering into the wonderful world of the "JAMStack" (Javascript, API, markup). I'm also a dad of two kids and an avid rollerblader.

### What I'm about

I strive to create useful, beautiful, blazingly fast websites for my discerning clients. My professional site is at [kitsuksisdesign.com](https://kitsuksisdesign.com). Check it out.

### Where Iâ€˜m at

I live in beautiful Port Alberni on Vancouver Island.
